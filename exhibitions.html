                    <p><strong>In October 2020, Green Hall Gallery opened to the Yale community only under Yale’s <a class="about-link "href="https://covid19.yale.edu/health-guidelines">COVID safety guidelines.</a></strong></p>  
                    <p>During the Spring 2021 semester, exhibitions will be open only to members of the School of Art community, who must follow all rules regarding wearing masks and social distancing and sign up for a reservation slot using the appropriate link below.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The graduate student’s primary educational experience at Yale is centered on the student’s own studio activity. Supporting this enterprise are the experience, knowledge, and skills gained from rigorous, structured courses such as drawing, filmmaking, the relativity of color, and the rich academic offerings found throughout Yale. Each student is routinely exposed to many aesthetic positions through encounters with faculty members and visitors. The School is devoted not only to the refinement of visual skills, but also to the cultivation of the mind. Students must bring creative force and imagination to their own development, for these qualities cannot be taught—they can only be stimulated and appreciated.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The School of Art galleries in Green Hall provide a year-round forum for the exhibition of work by students, faculty, and special guests in the four graduate departments of the School and the undergraduate program. During exhibitions, Green Hall Gallery at 1156 Chapel Street is typically open to the public but due to COVID-19, it will remain open only to the Yale School of Art community until further notice.</p>

                    <br>   
                    <p>All at once—looking back, tripping forward, standing still. All at once—plugged in, displayed, replayed, looped. All at once—planes, edges, corners. All at once—outwards, inwards, downwards, backwards. All at once—far away, close by, in motion. All at once—displaced, misplaced, replaced. All at once—everything, nothing, fleeting. All at once.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>All at Once brings together the work of this year’s graduating class through a unique merging of the physical and the virtual of our current environment. From April 22 to April 28, a continuously evolving live feed of work will be broadcasted 24/7 at allatonce.space—while the physical show will be on view in person at Green Hall Gallery during regular hours.*</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Featuring work by 2021 MFA degree candidates in Graphic Design: Herdimas Anggara, Milo Bonacci, Bianca Ibarlucea, Furqan Jawed, Harin Jung, Jun Jung, Minhwan Kim, Nick Massarelli, Anežka Minarikova, Luiza Dale, Ana Lobo, Mengyi Qian, Anna Sagström, and Mianwei Wang.</p>

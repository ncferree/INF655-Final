                    <h4>Fall 2021 Admission Deadlines and Notices</h4>
                    <p>The online application for programs beginning in the 2021–2022 academic year can be accessed <a href=" https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply">here</a>. All applications for Fall 2021 must be submitted no later than 11:59:59 PM – EST on Tuesday, January 5, 2021.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>References and supporting documents:</strong> While references and TOEFL scores (if applicable) may continue to be received after the January 5th deadline, review of applications begins soon thereafter. Applicants are thus urged to impress upon those writing reference letters, or submitting items on their behalf, that the timely submission of such documents is critical to guarantee inclusion in the admission committee’s review.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Please also note that upon entering an individual as a reference in the application system, a reference request and URL to upload the recommendation letter is automatically sent to the recipient’s email. Applicants who decide to remove a specific reference from their application must notify that individual directly as the link will become inactive.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The non-refundable fee to apply is $100. Please note that Yale School or Art practices need-blind admission therefore we do not waive admission application fees.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Application Status:</strong>Due to the high volume of incoming applications and processing which will be happening remotely this cycle, our office is unable to provide application status checks or confirm the receipt of items by phone or by email. Applicants should familiarize themselves with their Yale admission status page (accessed by logging into the application system) which will indicate outstanding items.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The mission of the Yale School of Art is to provide students with intellectually informed, hands-on instruction in the practice of an array of visual arts media within the context of a liberal arts university. As a part of the first institution of higher learning to successfully integrate a studio-based education into such a broad pedagogical framework, the Yale School of Art has a long and distinguished history of training artists of the highest caliber. A full-time faculty of working artists in conjunction with a diverse cross-section of accomplished visiting artists collaborate to design a program and foster an environment where the unique talents and perspectives of individual students can emerge and flourish.</p>
                    <br>    
                    <p>Receipt of items submitted by digital upload is updated in real time on the application status page checklist. Please allow one week for credentials received by postal mail to be reflected in the status page.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p><strong>Admission Decision Notification:</strong>First-round admission decisions, which include interview invitations as well as denials, will be sent in February.</p>
                    <h4>Entrance Requirements</h4>
                    <p>The School of Art requires for admission a high degree of capability and commitment. Applicants must hold a bachelor’s degree from an accredited college or university or a diploma from a four-year accredited professional art school. In exceptional cases and most particularly in light of the differences among educational structures and opportunities in the international art world today, the admissions committee may waive these prerequisites if other proofs of preparation and accomplishment are deemed sufficient equivalents by the committee. In either case, admission to the School of Art is on a highly selective and competitive basis.

                  <div class="col">
                    <h4>Admission</h4>
                    <p>Students are admitted to Yale’s MFA for the Fall semester of each year only. Applicants are notified of the admission committee’s decisions on preliminary selections in February, and final decisions in early March. No information about decisions will be given over the phone or advance of the batch written release to all finalists. To apply for more than one area of concentration, separate applications, fees, and supporting documentation must be submitted. The work submitted should be representative of the applicant’s experience in that particular field. Applying to more than one program does not increase an applicant’s chances of selection.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Please note: Yale School of Art does not practice admission deferment; An offer of admission for Fall 2021 is valid only for enrollment for that year regardless of the in-residence conditions of the Yale campus at that time. Applicants who are offered admission but choose not to enroll are welcome to reapply to the School in a future cycle.</p>
                    <br>
                    <h4>Admission Procedures for Preliminary Selection</h4>
                    <p>An application to the School of Art requires forethought and planning. It is important to read all of the application instructions carefully. Following these instructions will ensure that your application is viewed to best advantage.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>The Yale School of Art application for the 2020–2021 academic year is available <a href="https://apply.art.yale.edu/apply">online</a>. The information that follows will assist you in filing the application online. For an explanation of specific requirements for each area of study, please refer to the departmental sections that follow.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application materials:</strong></p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>Submit the online application. Application portal opens on October 5 and may be worked until the January 5 deadline. As it generally takes several weeks to complete an application, it is strongly recommended that applicants prepare their materials early to ensure completion by the deadline.</li>
                        <li>References from three persons practicing or teaching in the field in which application is made, attesting to the applicant’s ability and competence in that field.</li>
                        <li>Transcripts of academic record for the bachelor’s degree and/or professional art schools attended. Student/unofficial copies may be uploaded to the application for the preliminary jury. Official transcripts will ONLY be required for applicants invited to interview. If invited to interview, official transcripts should be mailed to: Yale School of Art Admissions, POB 208339, New Haven, CT 06520-8339. Neither junior college transcripts nor Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores are required.</li>
                        <li>Portfolio of work. Applicants who fail to upload a portfolio as outlined by the stated deadline will NOT be considered. The portfolio should represent images of your best work, indicate your current direction, and demonstrate your ability. At least half of the images should represent work done within the last twelve months, and all should be from within the last three years. Chronological order of year is embedded in our system, and you will not be able to override it. The application system used by Yale requires that one image from the portfolio be designated as a “representative work.” This selection is simply the default image for the cover page of each application file. As such, applicants have historically selected the piece which most strongly represents ideas central to their current body of work.</li>
                      </ol>
                    <p>Do not include more than one image on the screen, nor embed other pages of a publication or video within the images you place in your portfolio. Do not include detail photos of work in your portfolio unless you consider them absolutely necessary. Under no circumstances should more than two detail shots be included. Portfolio requirements differ depending upon area of concentration; be sure to follow the instructions for the area to which you are applying. We strongly recommend that you review your images on a Mac OS to be certain that they are accurately represented.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>NOTE: All supporting documents that are submitted as a requirement for admission become a part of the official file and cannot be returned to the applicant or forwarded to another institution either in copy or original form.</p>
